## Assignments

1. Analyse the provided frontend and notice the connection points with the smart contracts (FidelityPoints and Catalog).
2. Try to understand what the deployment script does and why is it useful.
3. Create `Add points` functionality to add fidelity points so that you can buy products later. Use the methods from the smart contract. Check the examples if you need help. Note that this operation must take place in the local network, so make sure you imported at least one of the 20 of the generated accounts in Metamask to have enough funds to make transactions and call contract methods.
4. Complete the `handleProductBuy` function from frontend by making calls to the Catalog and FidelityPoints contracts. Test in frontend
